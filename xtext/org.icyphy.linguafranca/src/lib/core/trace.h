 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * Definitions of tracepoint events for use with the C code generator and any other
 * code generator that uses the C infrastructure (such as the Python code generator).
 *
 * FIXME: How to use.
 *
 * The trace file is named trace.lft and is a binary file with the following format:
 *
 * Header:
 * * instant_t: The start time. This is both the starting physical time and the starting logical time.
 * * int: Size N of the table mapping pointers to descriptions.
 * This is followed by N records each of which has:
 * * A pointer value (the key).
 * * A null-terminated string (the description).
 *
 * Traces:
 * A sequence of traces, each of which begins with an int giving the length of the trace
 * followed by binary representations of the trace_record struct written using fwrite().
 */

 * Trace an event identified by a type and a pointer to the self struct of the reactor instance.
 * This is a generic tracepoint function. It is better to use one of the specific functions.
 * @param event_type The type of event (see trace_event_t in trace.h)
 * @param object The pointer to the traced object, e.g. self struct of the reactor instance in the trace table.
 * @param reaction_index The index of the reaction or -1 if the trace is not of a reaction.
 * @param worker The thread number of the worker thread or 0 for unthreaded execution.
 * @param physical_time If the caller has already accessed physical time, provide it here.
 *  Otherwise, provide NULL. This argument avoids a second call to get_physical_time
 *  and ensures that the physical time in the trace is the same as that used by the caller.
 * @param extra_delay The extra delay passed to schedule(). If not relevant for this event
 *  type, pass 0.
